## General Information
- I wanted some experience using Next as I'm getting more into React and loved the simplicty of the framework. Routing and SSR were a bit difficult to get to grips with initially but the more work with it, the better. As I'm working more on a component based architecture through React and Next, I can see the benefit of building applications using these libraries and frameworks.
